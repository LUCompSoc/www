## ‚ú® Contributing

Want to contribute? Start by creating an [issue][repo-issues] (or read any existing ones) so that we can discuss your ideas. We use the GitHub issue tracker to monitor bugs and suggestions for new features.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Install** the system/project dependencies
4. **Commit** your changes to your own branch
5. **Push** your work back up to your fork
6. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

See the setup and development guidance below.

## üõ† Project setup

### System Dependencies

- [Git][git]

You don't need to learn to use the command line version of Git straight away, but it's good to know how it works!

- [Node.js v12][node] - JavaScript runtime
- [yarn][yarn] - node package manager
- [Docker Desktop][docker] (to run tests in the server environment)

_We use Docker containers so that we can test our code in an environment as close to production as possible. No more ["It works on my machine!"][womm]. You should run tests on your code before submitting a pull request._

**Need help to install these?** We can point you in the right direction in our [Discord][discord] server!

### Project Dependencies

- [Vue.js 2.x][vuejs] (v3 was recently released, but Vuetify hasn't been updated yet)
- [Vuetify][vuetify] - design framework

You will need the [Vue CLI][vue-cli] to build and run the website locally. This can be installed
using the following command:

```
‚ûú yarn global add @vue/cli
```

## üèó Development

Make sure to install the system and project dependencies above before getting started.

Next, clone your fork of the repository to your own machine and install the package dependencies.

```
‚ûú git clone https://github.com/<username>/www lucompsoc-www
‚ûú cd lucompsoc-www
‚ûú yarn (or yarn install if you want to be verbose)
```

Now you can check everything is working properly by starting the local development server:

```
‚ûú yarn serve
yarn run v1.22.5
$ vue-cli-service serve
 INFO  Starting development server...
 DONE  Compiled successfully in 6983ms

  App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/ 
```

You should now be able to see the website if you open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser!
